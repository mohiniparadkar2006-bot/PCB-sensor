# PCB-sensor
 A simmple and clean AC to DC rectifier circcuit desgined using EasyEDA . The project includes a complete schematic  PCB layout and 3D render  the bored uses two 2 pins terminal connectors (P1,P2) and four SMD diodes (D1-D4) arranged in a bridge style configuration for basic rectification and polarity protection.
